SET content = '# Warm Outreach Playbook for Mobile Bar Owners

Nurture existing connections to drive repeat bookings and referrals—without being salesy. This playbook focuses on strategy and timing, while you can generate personalized scripts using our AI tool.

> **How PinkWizard Helps**: Use the CRM to segment contacts by temperature (Hot/Warm/Cool) and set up automated follow-up cadences that align with the timelines below.

## Data Insights for Expectations

For $1k–$10k decisions, cold buyers often need ~25 interactions; warm inbound usually needs 5–12 touches (eRelationship, 2025; EmailTooltester, 2025).

**Target**: 5–8 meaningful touches with warm contacts to convert or generate referrals.

## What "Value" Looks Like for Mobile Bars

- **Seasonal inspiration cocktail menu** (PDF or 2–3 images)
- **"What''s trending this season" mini-note** (3 bullets: zero-proof welcome, hot cocktail station, fewer SKUs = faster lines)
- **Micro case studies/testimonials** (corporate, HOA, private)
- **30–45s reel**: setup → service → happy guests
- **Forwardable partner blurb** (client-facing language they can paste to Slack/email)

> **How PinkWizard Helps**: Track which assets you''ve sent to each contact and schedule follow-ups automatically. The activity logging system helps you remember what content resonated with each contact type.

## The Relationship Temperature Scale

### Hot (Last 90 Days)
Recent convo/booking, active engagement, fresh referral.
**Approach**: Direct but respectful.

### Warm (3–12 Months) 
Previous work or periodic interaction.
**Approach**: Re-intro with value.

### Cool (12+ Months)
Dormant; no recent contact.
**Approach**: Rekindle with context + useful asset.

> **How PinkWizard Helps**: Use contact tags to mark temperature levels and set up different cadence rules for each temperature in your CRM settings.

## Cadence by Temperature

### Hot Connections (Last 90 Days)
**Goal**: Convert to booking or specific referral in 5–8 touches.

**Touch 1**: Seasonal menu + fast estimate ask.
- **CTA**: "Reply with date + headcount and I'll send a 60‑second estimate."

**Touch 2**: Trend mini-note (zero-proof/hot cocktail/line speed) + 1 question.
- **CTA**: "Want to include a zero‑proof welcome? Y/N"

**Touch 3**: Micro case study (similar audience) + specific next step.
- **CTA**: "Want me to price two options so you can compare?"

**Touch 4**: Quick check; keep it under 30 seconds.

**Touch 5**: Friendly checkpoint; offer an easy off-ramp.
- **CTA**: "If timing's off, I'll send our monthly trend note—sound good?"

### Warm Connections (3–12 Months)
**Goal**: Re‑engage and surface needs within 2–3 weeks.

**Touch 1**: Re‑intro + seasonal menu or trend note; reference last event.
- **CTA**: "Want the menu PDF?"

**Touch 2**: Micro case study tailored to their world.
- **CTA**: "Interested in pricing examples for [month]?"

**Touch 3**: Light touch.
- **CTA**: "Are you planning anything for [month]? I can send a quick range."

### Cool Connections (12+ Months)
**Goal**: Rekindle with context and value; no hard sell.

**Touch 1**: "Catching up + value-first."
- **CTA**: "Want the seasonal menu or I'll just keep you on our updates?"

**Touch 2**: Insight-first note with one actionable trend.
- **CTA**: "Want the mini menu that matches this?"

**Touch 3**: Invite to see a public pop-up/tasting or offer a two-option estimate.

> **How PinkWizard Helps**: Set up these exact cadences in your CRM settings with the timing and messaging templates. The system will automatically remind you when to send each touch and track your response rates.

## Generate Your Custom Scripts

Instead of using generic templates, create personalized messages that reflect your unique voice and specific situation using our **AI Outreach Generator**.

### Why Use AI-Generated Scripts?
- **Personalized**: Tailored to your specific contact and situation
- **Always Fresh**: Never sounds templated or robotic  
- **Context-Aware**: Incorporates your business details and relationship history
- **Tone-Matched**: Matches your communication style

### How to Generate Scripts
1. Go to the **AI Outreach** section in your dashboard
2. Select your contact and relationship temperature (Hot/Warm/Cool)
3. Choose the touch number in your cadence (Touch 1, 2, 3, etc.)
4. Specify the value you''re offering (menu, case study, trend note)
5. Let AI generate a personalized message

### Script Generation Tips
- **Be Specific**: The more context you provide, the better your script
- **Include Details**: Mention previous events, mutual connections, or specific needs
- **Set Your Tone**: Professional, casual, or friendly - the AI adapts
- **Reference Your Assets**: Tell the AI which menu, case study, or trend note you''re sharing

> **PinkWizard Pro Tip**: Generate multiple versions and A/B test them to see what works best with different contact types. The CRM tracks response rates to help you optimize.

## Timing Guidelines

### Email Timing
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Highest open rates
- **10am-12pm or 2pm-4pm**: Peak engagement windows
- **Avoid Mondays/Fridays**: Lower engagement

### Follow-Up Spacing
- **Hot contacts**: 3-5 business days between touches
- **Warm contacts**: 1 week between touches  
- **Cool contacts**: 2 weeks between touches

### Seasonal Considerations
- **Holiday seasons**: Start outreach 6-8 weeks early
- **Corporate events**: Align with budget cycles (Q4 for next year planning)
- **Wedding season**: Peak planning happens 6-12 months ahead
