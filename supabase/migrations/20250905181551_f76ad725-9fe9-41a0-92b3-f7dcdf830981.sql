-- Fix contacts table RLS to allow all authenticated users to manage their own contacts
-- Not just challenge participants or paid users

-- Drop restrictive policies that require user_can_write()
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own contacts" ON public.contacts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own contacts" ON public.contacts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own contacts" ON public.contacts;

-- Create simple policies that only require authentication
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own contacts"
