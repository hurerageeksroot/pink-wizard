-- Fix activities table RLS to allow all authenticated users to manage their own activities
-- Not just challenge participants or paid users

-- Drop restrictive policies that require user_can_write()
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own activities" ON public.activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own activities" ON public.activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own activities" ON public.activities;

-- Create simple policies that only require authentication
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own activities" 
ON public.activities 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own activities" 
ON public.activities 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own activities" 
ON public.activities 
FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
