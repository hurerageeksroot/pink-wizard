  content = 'Master timing and messaging without being pushy. This version reflects how mobile bars actually sell: no date holds, no floorplans/checklists—lean on inspiration menus, timely trends, proof, and relationships.

## 📊 Data insight: touchpoints that close

**Cold path** (typical $1k–$10k decisions): ~25 interactions before purchase (eRelationship, 2025).  
**Warm inbound path** (referrals, inquiries): ~5–12 interactions (EmailTooltester, 2025).

### What it means
- Cold leads need more, better-spaced touches; don''t quit at 4–6.
- Stack high-quality touches early to convert cold → warm.
- Warm leads close faster when you respond rapidly and stay relevant.

## 🎯 Principles of strategic persistence

- **Be helpful, not harassing**: each touch adds value (menu inspo, trend, proof, simple next step).
- **One clear CTA**: "Reply with date + headcount" or "Want the seasonal menu PDF?"
- **Vary angles**: rotate inspiration, trend, proof, and urgency—don''t repeat yourself.
- **Permission-based tone**: "Open to…?" "Would it help if…?"
- **Channel fit**: Email for details, phone to clarify, LinkedIn for B2B context, IG for light proof. SMS only if they text you first.
- **Log everything**: last touch, next touch, what they engaged with.

## ✅ What counts as a quality "touch"

- Personal email with one clear CTA
- Seasonal inspiration cocktail menu (PDF or image)
- Brief industry trend note relevant to holiday events
- Short case study/testimonial tile
- 30–45s reel of setup-to-service or guest reactions
- Phone call/voicemail + same-day recap email
- Invite to tasting/FAM night or holiday pop-up viewing

### Touchpoint scoring (helps pacing)
- **+2**: Quote sent, call+recap, tasting RSVP
- **+1**: Email with menu/trend/proof, contextual DM/LI message
- **0**: Passive likes

**Expectation setting**: Cold ~12–15 points before a close; Warm ~6–8.

## 🌡️ Cadence by lead temperature

### A) Cold leads (no prior relationship, no inquiry yet)
*Goal: Move from the ~25-touch path toward the 5–12 warm range by stacking valuable touches in 7–10 days, then pace out.*

- **Day 0** (Email): Introduce succinctly; offer seasonal inspiration cocktail menu. CTA: "Want the holiday menu PDF?"
- **Day 2** (Email): Short trend drop (e.g., zero-proof demand, hot cocktails, fewer SKUs = faster service) + 1-sentence proof. CTA: "Curious to see pricing examples?"
- **Day 5** (Phone + recap email): 30-second voicemail; recap via email with a micro-case study (e.g., "Cut lines, rave feedback"). CTA: "Open to a 10-minute fit check this week?"
- **Day 9** (Social touch): LinkedIn connection + light message or IG DM reacting to a relevant post. CTA: "Want me to send our mini holiday menu here?"
- **Day 14** (Email): Soft nudge with testimonial tile and a time-based note (e.g., "Prime dates go first"). CTA: "If planning a team/resident event, want sample packages?"
- **After Day 14**: Move to light nurture (every 3–4 weeks) unless they engage.

### B) Warm inbound leads (referrals, form fills, DMs, replies)
*Goal: Close in 5–8 touches over 3–5 days with fast, relevant responses. No date holds—use fast quoting and proof.*

- **Within 2 hours** (Email/DM reply): Thank them, ask for date + headcount + basic preferences (beer/wine, cocktails, zero-proof). Offer to send seasonal inspiration menu. CTA: "Share date + headcount and I''ll send a same-day estimate."
- **Same day** (Email): Send simple estimate/starting ranges and a 1-page seasonal inspiration menu. Include one testimonial. CTA: "Want me to fine-tune this for your guest count?"
- **Day 2** (Phone + recap email): Quick call attempt; recap via email with 1 trend that makes their event better (e.g., hot cocktail welcome). CTA: "Interested in adding a hot cocktail welcome? Y/N"
- **Day 3** (Email): Case study relevant to their audience (corporate, HOA, wedding). CTA: "Ready for a finalized quote with your preferences?"
- **Day 5** (Email): Friendly checkpoint. CTA: "Still planning? Happy to price two options so you can compare."

### C) Warm network (past clients, vendors, venues, planners you know; stay top-of-mind)
*Goal: Maintain 5–8 meaningful touches per quarter without selling hard. Think relationship-first.*

**Monthly rhythm (repeatable)**
- **Week 1** (Email): Seasonal inspo menu or "What''s trending this month" mini-note (3 bullets), zero hard sell. CTA: "Want the full menu PDF?"
- **Week 2** (Social DM or comment): Congratulate them on a recent event post; add a helpful, specific idea. No CTA required.
- **Week 3** (Email or LI message): One-paragraph micro case study with a useful takeaway (e.g., batching = faster lines). CTA: "Want the batching play note? I can send it."
- **Week 4** (Optional call/text if appropriate): Quick check-in: "Anything I can support for your Dec calendar?" CTA: "Want a 60-second price range for your next event?"

*If they surface a need, switch them to Warm inbound fast-lane.*

### D) Dormant/old leads (stalled or ghosted)
*Goal: Re-open with something new, not "just checking in."*

**Trigger-based reactivation** (Email):
- **New seasonal menu**: "New holiday sips we''re pouring this month—want the PDF?"
- **Trend shift**: "Zero-proof welcome drinks are crushing it—want a mocktail mini menu?"
- **Social proof**: "3-line case study from a 150-guest office party—want details?"

*If no response after 2 touches 5–7 days apart: Move to monthly nurture.*

Hi [Name], I''m [Your Name] with [Brand]. We run mobile bars that keep lines moving and menus festive (mocktails included). We''ve pulled together a 2025 Holiday Inspiration Menu (hot cocktails, zero-proof, and two guest-favorite signatures). Want the PDF?

**Subject**: Quick details for your holiday bar

Awesome, [Name]! If you share date + headcount + any preferences (beer/wine vs cocktails, zero-proof), I''ll send a tailored estimate today. I can also include our seasonal inspiration menu so you can choose a vibe (classic, cozy, or playful). Sound good?

### Proof — Case study (Email)
**Subject**: "Best holiday party yet" (quick proof)

Last December, we served 120 guests in 2 hours with a 3‑drink menu (incl. mocktail). Lines stayed under ~2 minutes and HR called it their smoothest event. Want the details and pricing examples?

Hi [Name], it''s [Your Name] with [Brand]. I sent over seasonal menu options and a quick estimate. If you share headcount, I''ll fine-tune it today. I''ll email a 60‑second summary—reply there with any questions. Thanks!

### Final friendly check-in (Email)

If you''re still mapping the party, I can price two options so you can compare (classic vs premium + mocktail). If not needed, no worries—I''ll send our trends update next month. What''s most useful?

## 🤝 "Persistent, not pushy" language
